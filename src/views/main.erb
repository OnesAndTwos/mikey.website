    <p>My wife collects recipes so we now have little scraps of paper littering the house. This is my attempt at
      helping her store and organize these so I can live an uncluttered existance.</p>

    <h2>Blog</h2>

      My blog that I have been meaning to build for many years. Hopefully i'll have some interesting things to say
      about programming and life but somehow, I doubt it :)
